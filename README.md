# Random-MTG-Commander-CLI
A small CLI program started as a suitable project for a code sample, written in PERL.

Desinged to fill a hole in both Scryfall, a popular Magic: the Gathering card database, and EDHRec, a website concerned with the Commander format. Neither website has a utility that lets you randomly generate a legal commander based on their color identity. This tool does exactly that.

In order to run the program, download the <b>proj</b> folder. From inside, run the command ```perl main.pl```.

From here, the program will greet you. Enter in a valid color identity to randomize a suitable Magic: the Gathering commander. You may continue to roll new commanders or look back at old ones by entering the same color identity as the one's you'd like to revisit.

The utility is hardly complete (there's always more work to do!), but its desired core functionality is present and accounted for. The first update would add in support for both Planeswalker and Double Faced commander cards. The second update would be concerned with the much more complicated task of dealing with Partner commanders.
